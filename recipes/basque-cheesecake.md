# Basque Cheesecake

I made the recipe in a 9-inch springform pan instead of a 10-inch, so I had extra batter. I poured batter to about 3/4 of the way up the springform pan, then poured the rest into muffin tins about 2/3 of the way up. In total, the recipe is enough for one cheesecake and 9 mini cheesecakes.

## Tools

* 9 in springform pan
* Large bowl
* Parchment paper
* Measuring cups
* Measuring spoons
* Spatula
* Sifter

## Ingredients

* unsalted butter (for pan)
* 2 lb cream cheese, room temperature (leave on countertop, at least 2 hours)
* 1 1/2 cup sugar
* 6 large eggs
* 2 cup heavy cream
* 1 teaspoon kosher salt
* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
* 1/3 cup all-purpose flour

## Steps

### Batter

1. Beat cream cheese and sugar together until all the sugar is dissolved and cream cheese is smooth.
1. Add eggs one at a time until barely mixed, then add cream, salt, and vanilla and mix until combined.
1. Sift the flour in two batches into the batter. Don't overmix.

### Cheesecake

1. Preheat oven to 400F.
1. Butter springform pan and line with parchment paper with some overhang (does not need to be pretty, just avoid large pleats).
1. Pour the batter into the springform pan.
1. Bake until deeply browned on the top, about 60-70 minutes. Center will still  jiggle and cake will have risen significantly.
1. Let cool on the countertop, then unmold and enjoy!

### Mini Cheesecakes

1. Preheat oven to 450F.
1. Butter muffin tin generously.
1. Pour batter into muffin tin about 2/3 full.
1. Bake until browned on top, about 20-25 minutes. You can also broil the tops to get the right color, just keep an eye on them.
1. Let cool on the countertop, then unmold and enjoy!

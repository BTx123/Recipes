# Scallion Pancakes

## Tools

* plastic wrap/parchment paper
* 2 bowls
* spoon
* measuring spoons
* measuring cups
* large bowl
* rolling pin/wine bottle
* plastic cutting board/work surface
* saucepan
* fine mesh sieve
* knife
* 8-inch nonstick skillet

## Ingredients

**For dipping sauce:**

* 2 tablespoon soy sauce
* 2 tablespoon rice vinegar
* 1 tablespoon sesame oil
* 1/2 red chili paste (optional)
* 2 tablespoon sugar

**For oil-flour mixture:**

* 2 tablespoon lard/schmaltz (substitute with coconut oil or butter), melted
* 2 tablespoon all-purpose flour
* 1/4 teaspoon salt

**For pancakes:**

* 2 cups all-purpose flour
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* 2/3 cup hot water (+ more if needed)
* 1 cup chopped green onion (green parts only)
* cooking oil

## Steps

### Dipping Sauce

1. Put all dipping sauce ingredients into saucepan and bring to boil to dissolve sugar. Remove from heat and let cool, then store in bowl for later.

### Dough

1. Mix oil-flour ingredients into paste and set aside.
1. Sift all-purpose flour and stir in salt.
1. Stir in hot water, adding more 1 teaspoon at a time (if necessary) until a dough ball forms. The dough should not be sticky.
1. Let rest covered for 30 minutes or up to 2 hours at room temperature. The dough will be more hydrated and smooth if you let it rest longer.

### Pancakes

1. Divide dough into 8 pieces and cover until ready to use.
1. On a lightly oiled surface, roll out one piece of dough into a square as thin as you can (about 8 inches on the side).
1. Brush oil-flour mixture on top (you don't need too much!) and sprinkle about 2 tablespoon of chopped scallion, leaving some space on the edges.
1. Roll up dough into a log, then roll log into pinwheel and cover to rest as you work on the other pieces of dough.
1. Repeat steps 2-4 until all 8 pieces of dough are pinwheels.
1. Flatten the pinwheels with your palm and roll out to about 6 inches in diameter. Store separated by parchment or plastic wrap to prevent it from sticking to the other pancakes.
1. Repeat previous step for all pinwheels.

### Cooking

1. Preheat a nonstick skillet on high with 2 tablespoon of oil.
1. Lower heat to medium once hot and put pancake into skillet, cooking each side for 1-2 minutes until golden brown.
1. Remove pancake fom skillet onto paper towel and scrunch up once cooled slightly to ensure flakiness.
1. Repeat for all pancakes, adding oil as needed. Without oil, the dough will have dark spots instead of browning, which is not what you want.

### Serving

1. Serve immediately with dipping sauce on the side.
